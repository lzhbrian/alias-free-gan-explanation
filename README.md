**motivation of this article**: So, the thing is, I've been reading the paper for several days, and the paper is written in a way that I find really hard to understand. Thus, I decide to rephrase the main idea of the paper in my language. Some explanation might be different from the original paper. Of course, I might be making mistakes, so please feel free to correct me.

**Disclaimer**: This paragraph is only my personal understanding. One is suggested to read the original paper.
